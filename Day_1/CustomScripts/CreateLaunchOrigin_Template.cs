    // Goal: We will use this script to create an object in Unity and change some of its properties


    // Start is called before the first frame update
    void Start()
    {
        // TODO: Create the GameObject "cube" based on the primitite type cube

        // TODO:Change its x, y, and z scale to 0.2f (the f means float)
        
        // TODO: Change its x, y, and z position to 0f, 1.12f, and -3.21f respectively 



        // Optional Exercises! -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
        // Exercise 1: set this cube as a child object of the cannon object

        // Exercise 2: turn off the mesh renderer and rigidbody on this cube if they exist
    }

    // You can also create prefabs from scripts but it is more complicated. 
    // See here if you're interested to learn how: https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/PrefabUtility.html
